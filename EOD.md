# EOD Log

In the spirit of John Carmack's .plan files I have created this EOD Log to shut my brain up at the end of day.

I should have started this a long time ago.

## 09/25/24:

### DONE

- finished & merged class-based refactor

### TODO

- tag files in \_SPLITS / \_COMPS directories
- figure out how to handle splits and comps
  - Directory class?
  - Inheritance from Album > Split/Compilation or Album > Compilation > Split
- add `Parser.warnings` for things like missing Composer field & print
